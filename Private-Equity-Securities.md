# Private Equity Securities

- Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors via non-public offerings, such as private placements
- Because they are not listed on public exchanges, there is no active secondary market for these securities
- As a result, private equity securities do not have “market determined” quoted prices, are highly illiquid, and require negotiations between investors in order to be traded
- In addition, financial statements and other important information needed to determine the fair value of private equity securities may be difficult to obtain because the issuing companies are typically not required by regulatory authorities to publish this information
