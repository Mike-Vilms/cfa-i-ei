# Private Equity Securities

- Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors via non-public offerings, such as private placements
- Because they are not listed on public exchanges, there is no active secondary market for these securities
- As a result, private equity securities do not have “market determined” quoted prices, are highly illiquid, and require negotiations between investors in order to be traded
- In addition, financial statements and other important information needed to determine the fair value of private equity securities may be difficult to obtain because the issuing companies are typically not required by regulatory authorities to publish this information
- There are three primary types of private equity investments: 
  - **Venture Capital**, 
  - **Leveraged Buyouts**, and
  - **Private Investment in Public Equity**
- **Venture capital investments** provide “seed” or start-up capital, early-stage financing, or mezzanine financing to companies that are in the early stages of development and require additional capital for expansion
  - These funds are then used to finance the company’s product development and growth
  - The exit return earned by these private equity investors is based on the price that the securities can be sold for if and when the start-up company first goes public, either via an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market or by being sold to other investors
- **Leveraged buyout (LBO)** occurs when a group of investors (such as the company’s management or a private equity partnership) uses a large amount of debt to purchase all of the outstanding common shares of a publicly traded company
  - After the shares are purchased, they cease to trade on an exchange and the investor group takes full control of the company. In other words, the company is taken “private” or has been privatized
  - The ultimate objective of a buyout (LBO or MBO) is to restructure the acquired company and later take it “public” again by issuing new shares to the public in the primary market
- **Private Investment in Public Equity**(PIPE) - sought by a public company that is in need of additional capital quickly and is willing to sell a sizeable ownership position to a private investor or investor group
  - Depending on how urgent the need is and the size of the capital requirement, the private investor may be able to purchase shares in the company at a significant discount to the publicly-quoted market price
