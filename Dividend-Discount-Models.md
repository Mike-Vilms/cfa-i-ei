# Dividend Discount Models

- The payout of regular cash dividends to common shareholders follows a fairly standard chronology that is set in motion once the company’s board of directors votes to pay the dividend:
  - **Declaration date** - the day that the company issues a statement declaring a specific dividend
  - **Ex-dividend date** (or ex-date) - the first date that a share trades without (i.e., “ex”) the dividend
  - **Holder-of-record date** -  the date that a shareholder listed on the company’s books will be deemed to have ownership of the shares for purposes of receiving the upcoming dividend
  - **Payment date** - day that the company actually mails out (or electronically transfers) a dividend payment to shareholders
