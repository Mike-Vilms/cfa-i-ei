# Forms of Market Efficiency
- In his framework, Eugene Fama defines three forms of efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and strong
- A finding that investors can consistently earn abnormal returns by trading on the basis of information is evidence contrary to market efficiency

#### Weak Form
- In the **weak-form efficient market hypothesis**, security prices fully reflect all past market data, which refers to all historical price and trading volume information
- If markets are weak-form efficient, past trading data are already reflected in current prices and investors cannot predict future price changes by extrapolating prices or patterns of prices from the past
- Tests of whether securities markets are weak-form efficient require looking at patterns of prices:
  - One approach is to see whether there is any serial correlation in security returns, which would imply a predictable pattern
  - An alternative approach to test weak-form efficiency is to examine specific trading rules that attempt to exploit historical trading data. If any such trading rule consistently generates abnormal risk-adjusted returns after trading costs, this evidence will contradict weak-form efficiency
- *Can technical analysts profit from trading on past trends? Overall, the evidence indicates that investors cannot consistently earn abnormal profits using past prices or other technical analysis strategies in developed markets*

#### Semi-Strong Form
- In a **semi-strong-form efficient market**, prices reflect all publicly known and available information
- **Publicly available information** includes financial statement data (such as earnings, dividends, corporate investments, changes in management, etc.) and financial market data (such as closing prices, shares traded, etc.)
- In a semi-strong market, efforts to analyze publicly available information are futile
  - That is, analyzing earnings announcements of companies to identify underpriced or overpriced securities is pointless because the prices of these securities already reflect all publicly available information
- The results of most research are consistent with the view that developed securities markets might be semi-strong efficient. But some evidence suggests that the markets in developing countries may not be semi-strong efficient

#### Strong Form
- In a **strong-form efficient market**, security prices fully reflect both public and private information
- In the case of a strong-form efficient market, insiders would not be able to earn abnormal returns from trading on the basis of private information
- However, this is not likely because of the strong prohibitions against insider trading that are found in most countries

#### Implications of the Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Several implications can be drawn from the evidence on efficient markets for developed markets:
  - Securities markets are weak-form efficient, and therefore, investors cannot earn abnormal returns by trading on the basis of past trends in price
  - Securities markets are semi-strong efficient, and therefore, analysts who collect and analyze information must consider whether that information is already reflected in security prices and how any new information affects a security’s value
  - Securities markets are not strong-form efficient because securities laws are intended to prevent exploitation of private information
- **Fundamental analysis** is the examination of publicly available information and the formulation of forecasts to estimate the intrinsic value of assets
  - Buy and sell decisions depend on whether the current market price is less than or greater than the estimated intrinsic value
- **Technical analysis.** Investors using technical analysis attempt to profit by looking at patterns of prices and trading volume. Although some price patterns persist, exploiting these patterns may be too costly and, hence, would not produce abnormal returns
- **Portfolio Management.**
  - If securities markets are weak-form and semi-strong-form efficient, the implication is that active trading, whether attempting to exploit price patterns or public information, is not likely to generate abnormal returns
  - In other words, **portfolio managers cannot beat the market on a consistent basis**, so therefore, passive portfolio management should outperform active portfolio management
  - So, what good are portfolio managers? The role of a portfolio manager is not necessarily to beat the market but, rather, to establish and manage a portfolio consistent with the portfolio’s objectives, with appropriate diversification and asset allocation, while taking into consideration the risk preferences and tax situation of the investor
