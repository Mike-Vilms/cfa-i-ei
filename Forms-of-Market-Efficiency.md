# Forms of Market Efficiency
- In his framework, Eugene Fama defines three forms of efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and strong
- A finding that investors can consistently earn abnormal returns by trading on the basis of information is evidence contrary to market efficiency

#### Weak Form
- In the **weak-form efficient market hypothesis**, security prices fully reflect all past market data, which refers to all historical price and trading volume information
- If markets are weak-form efficient, past trading data are already reflected in current prices and investors cannot predict future price changes by extrapolating prices or patterns of prices from the past
- Tests of whether securities markets are weak-form efficient require looking at patterns of prices:
  - One approach is to see whether there is any serial correlation in security returns, which would imply a predictable pattern
  - An alternative approach to test weak-form efficiency is to examine specific trading rules that attempt to exploit historical trading data. If any such trading rule consistently generates abnormal risk-adjusted returns after trading costs, this evidence will contradict weak-form efficiency
- *Can technical analysts profit from trading on past trends? Overall, the evidence indicates that investors cannot consistently earn abnormal profits using past prices or other technical analysis strategies in developed markets*

#### Semi-Strong Form
- In a **semi-strong-form efficient market**, prices reflect all publicly known and available information
- **Publicly available information** includes financial statement data (such as earnings, dividends, corporate investments, changes in management, etc.) and financial market data (such as closing prices, shares traded, etc.)

#### Strong Form
