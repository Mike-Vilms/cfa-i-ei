# Calculation of Index Value and Returns
- A security market index represents a given security market, market segment, or asset class
- Most indexes are constructed as portfolios of marketable securities
- The value of an index is calculated on a regular basis using either the actual or estimated market prices of the individual securities, known as **constituent securities**, within the index
