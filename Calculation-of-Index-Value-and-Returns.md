# Calculation of Index Value and Returns
- A security market index represents a given security market, market segment, or asset class
- Most indexes are constructed as portfolios of marketable securities
- The value of an index is calculated on a regular basis using either the actual or estimated market prices of the individual securities, known as **constituent securities**, within the index
- **Price return index**, also known as a price index, reflects only the prices of the constituent securities within the index
- **A total return index**, in contrast, reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income received since inception
