# Common Stock vs Preferred Stock

#### Common shares
- Represent an ownership interest in a company and are the predominant type of equity security
- Investors share in the operating performance of the company, participate in the governance process through voting rights, and have a claim on the companyâ€™s net assets in the case of liquidation
- Voting rights provide shareholders with the opportunity to participate in major corporate governance decisions, including the election of its board of directors, the decision to merge with or take over another company, and the selection of outside auditors
- Regular shareholder voting, where each share represents one vote, is referred to as **statutory voting**
- To better serve shareholders who own a small number of shares, **cumulative voting** is often used
  -  For example, under cumulative voting, if four board 
directors are to be elected, a shareholder who owns 100 shares is entitled to 400 votes 
and can either cast all 400 votes in favor of a single candidate or spread them across 
the candidates in any proportion. In contrast, under statutory voting, a shareholder 
would be able to cast only a maximum of 100 votes for each candidate.
