# Common Stock vs Preferred Stock

#### Common shares
- Represent an ownership interest in a company and are the predominant type of equity security
- Investors share in the operating performance of the company, participate in the governance process through voting rights, and have a claim on the company’s net assets in the case of liquidation
- Voting rights provide shareholders with the opportunity to participate in major corporate governance decisions, including the election of its board of directors, the decision to merge with or take over another company, and the selection of outside auditors
- Regular shareholder voting, where each share represents one vote, is referred to as **statutory voting**
- To better serve shareholders who own a small number of shares, **cumulative voting** is often used
  -  For example, under cumulative voting, if four board 
directors are to be elected, a shareholder who owns 100 shares is entitled to 400 votes 
and can either cast all 400 votes in favor of a single candidate or spread them across 
the candidates in any proportion. In contrast, under statutory voting, a shareholder 
would be able to cast only a maximum of 100 votes for each candidate.  
- Common shares may also be **callable or putable**. 
- **Callable common shares** (also known as redeemable common shares) give the issuing company the option (or right), but not the obligation, to buy back shares from investors at a call price that is specified when the shares are originally issued.
  - It is most common for companies to call (or redeem) their common shares when the market price is above the pre-specified call price
  - The company benefits because it can buy back its shares below the current market price and later resell them at a higher market price, and it can also reduce dividend payments to preserve capital, if required
  - Investors benefit because they receive a guaranteed return when their shares are called
- **Putable common shares** give investors the option or right to sell their shares (i.e., “put” them) back to the issuing company at a price that is specified when the shares are originally issued
- Investors will generally sell their shares back to the issuing company when the market price is **below the pre-specified put price**. Thus, the put option feature 
limits the potential loss for investors
- From the issuing company’s perspective, the put option facilitates raising capital because the shares are more appealing to investors

#### Preferred Stock
- Preference shares (or preferred stock) rank above common shares with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of the company’s net assets upon liquidation.
- However, preference shareholders generally do not share in the operating performance of the company and do not have any voting rights, unless explicitly allowed for at issuance
- Similar to the interest payments on debt securities, the dividends on preference shares are fixed and are generally higher than the dividends on common shares
- However, unlike interest payments, **preference dividends are not contractual obligations of the company**
- Similar to common shares, preference shares can be perpetual (i.e., no fixed maturity date), can pay dividends indefinitely, and can be callable or putable
- Dividends on preference shares can be 
  - Сumulative,
  - Non-cumulative,
  - Participating,
  - Non-participating, 
  - Or some combination thereof (i.e., cumulative participating, cumulative non-participating, non-cumulative participating, non-cumulative non-participating)
- Dividends on **cumulative preference shares** accrue so that if the company decides not to pay a dividend in one or more periods, the unpaid dividends accrue and must be paid in full before dividends on common shares can be paid
- In contrast, **non-cumulative preference shares** have no such provision
- However, the company is still not permitted to pay any dividends to common shareholders in the current period unless preferred dividends have been paid first
