# Cost of Equity

#### Cost of Debt
- When a company issues debt, the cost it incurs for the use of these funds is called the cost of debt
- The cost of debt is relatively easy to estimate because it reflects the periodic interest (or coupon) rate that the company is contractually obligated to pay to its bondholders (lenders)
- When investors purchase the company’s debt securities, their minimum required rate of return is the periodic rate of interest they charge the company for the use of their funds
- Therefore, the **company’s cost of debt** and the **investors’ minimum required rate of return on the debt** are the same

#### Cost of Equity ???
- When investors purchase the company’s equity securities, their **minimum required rate of return is based on the future cash flows they expect to receive**
- Minimum required return may differ across investors based on their expectations about the company’s future cash flows
- As a result, the company’s cost of equity may be different from the investors’ minimum required rate of return on equity(???)
- Because companies try to raise capital at the lowest possible cost, the company’s cost of equity is often used as a proxy for the investors’ minimum required rate of return(???)
- In other words, the **cost of equity** can be thought of as the **minimum expected rate of return that a company must offer its investors** to purchase its shares in the primary market and to maintain its share price in the secondary market(???)
- Two models commonly used to estimate a company’s cost of equity (or investors’ minimum required rate of return) are 
  - The dividend discount model (DDM) and
  - The capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
