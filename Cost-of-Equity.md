# Cost of Equity

- When a company issues debt, the cost it incurs for the use of these funds is called the cost of debt
- The cost of debt is relatively easy to estimate because it reflects the periodic interest (or coupon) rate that the company is contractually obligated to pay to its bondholders (lenders)
