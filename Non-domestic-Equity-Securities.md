# Non-domestic Equity Securities

#### Direct Investing
- Investors can use a variety of methods to invest in the equity of companies outside of their local market
- The most obvious is to buy and sell securities directly in foreign markets
- However, this means that all transactions — including the purchase and sale of shares, dividend payments, and capital gains—are in the company’s, not the investor’s, domestic currency

#### Depository Receipts
- A depository receipt (DR) is a security that trades like an ordinary share on a local exchange and represents an economic interest in a foreign company
  - A depository receipt is created when the equity shares of a foreign company are deposited in a bank (i.e., the depository) in the country on whose exchange the shares will trade
  - The depository then issues receipts that represent the shares that were deposited
- The responsibilities of the **depository bank** that issues the receipts include acting as custodian and as a registrar
  - This entails handling dividend payments, other taxable events, stock splits, and serving as the transfer agent for the foreign company whose securities the DR represents 
- A DR can be **sponsored or unsponsored**
  - A **sponsored DR** is when the foreign company whose shares are held by the depository has a direct involvement in the issuance of the receipts
  - Investors in sponsored DRs have the same rights as the direct owners of the common shares
  - In contrast, with an unsponsored DR, the underlying foreign company has no involvement with the issuance of the receipts
  - Instead, the depository purchases the foreign company’s shares in its domestic market and then issues the receipts through brokerage firms in the depository’s local market 
  - In this case, the depository bank, not the investors in the DR, retains the voting rights

#### Global Depository Receipts
- A global depository receipt (GDR) is issued outside of the company’s home country and outside of the United States
- The depository bank that issues GDRs is generally located (or has branches) in the countries on whose exchanges the shares are traded

#### American Depository Receipts
