# Industry Analysis

#### Barriers to Entry
- If incumbents are protected by barriers to entry, the threat of new entrants is lower, and incumbents may enjoy a more benign competitive environment
- Often, these barriers to entry can lead to greater **pricing power**, because potential competitors would find it difficult to enter the industry and undercut incumbents’ prices. Of course, high barriers to entry do not guarantee pricing power, because incumbents may compete fiercely among each other
  - Example: Anyone with a modest amount of capital and some culinary skill can open a **restaurant**, and popular restaurants quickly attract competition. As a result, the industry is very competitive, and many restaurants fail in their first few years of business
  - At the other end of the spectrum of barriers to entry are the global **credit card networks such as MasterCard and Visa**, both of which often post operating margins greater than 30 percent. Capital costs are one hurdle; also, building a massive data-processing network would not be cheap.
- **High barriers to entry do not automatically lead to good pricing power and attractive industry economics**
  - Examples to consider: auto making, commercial aircraft manufacturing, and refining industries

#### Industry Concentration
- Industries that are concentrated among a relatively small number of players often experience relatively less price competition.
  - Again, there are important exceptions, so the reader should not automatically assume that concentrated industries always have pricing power or that fragmented industries do not.

#### Price Competition
- Examples:
  - If Airbus charges too much for an A320, an airline can buy a Boeing 737.14 If BMW’s price for a four-door luxury sedan rises too high, customers can switch to a Mercedes or other luxury brand with similar features
  - Contrast these industries with asset management, one of a handful of industries that is both fragmented and characterized by strong pricing power. Despite the well documented impact of fees on future investment returns, the vast majority of asset management customers **do not make decisions on the basis of price**. Instead, asset management customers focus on historical returns, which allow this highly fragmented industry to maintain strong pricing power.
