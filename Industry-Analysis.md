# Industry Analysis

#### Barriers to Entry
- If incumbents are protected by barriers to entry, the threat of new entrants is lower, and incumbents may enjoy a more benign competitive environment
- Often, these barriers to entry can lead to greater **pricing power**, because potential competitors would find it difficult to enter the industry and undercut incumbentsâ€™ prices. Of course, high barriers to entry do not guarantee pricing power, because incumbents may compete fiercely among each other
  - Example: Anyone with a modest amount of capital and some culinary skill can open a **restaurant**, and popular restaurants quickly attract competition. As a result, the industry is very competitive, and many restaurants fail in their first few years of business
  - At the other end of the spectrum of barriers to entry are the global **credit card networks such as MasterCard and Visa**, both of which often post operating margins greater than 30 percent. Capital costs are one hurdle; also, building a massive data-processing network would not be cheap.
- **High barriers to entry do not automatically lead to good pricing power and attractive industry economics**
  - Examples to consider: auto making, commercial aircraft manufacturing, and refining industries

#### Industry Concentration
- Industries that are concentrated among a relatively small number of players often experience relatively less price competition.
  - Again, there are important exceptions, so the reader should not automatically assume that concentrated industries always have pricing power or that fragmented industries do not.
