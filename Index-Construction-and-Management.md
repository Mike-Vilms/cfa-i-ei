# Index Construction and Management

- The target market may be based on 
  - Asset class (equities, fixed income, real estate, commodities, hedge funds)
  - Geographic region (Japan, South Africa, Latin America, Europe)
  - Exchange on which the securities are traded (Shanghai, Toronto, Tokyo)
  - ...
- **Index Weighting** decision determines how much of each security to include in the index and has a substantial impact on an index’s value
  - Price Weighting: In price weighting, the weight on each constituent security is determined by dividing its price by the sum of all the prices of the constituent securities (example: DJIA)
    - Advantage of price weighting is its simplicity. 
    - The main disadvantage of price weighting is that it results in arbitrary weights for each security. In particular, a stock split in any one security causes arbitrary changes in the weights of all the constituents’ securities. 
  - Another simple index weighting method is equal weighting. This method assigns an equal weight to each constituent security at inception.
    - Primary advantage of equal weighting is its simplicity.
    - Disadvantages: first, securities that conistitute the largest fraction of the target market value are underrepresented, and securities that constitute a small fraction of the target market value are overrepresented. 
Second, after the index is constructed and the prices of constituent securities change, 
the index is no longer equally weighted. Therefore, maintaining equal weights requires 
frequent adjustments (rebalancing) to the index.
